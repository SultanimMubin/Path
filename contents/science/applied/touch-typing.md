# [Touch typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing)


- Type letters, not words
- Type using a steady speed
    - You should [hear keystroeks steadily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxVIpWfQhuE)
- Raise your wrist, don’t let them touch the desk
- Each finger supports a backslash (\) on keyboard
- Home keys are F for left hand, and J for right hand
- Source, keyboard, monitor. Never look at the keyboard or monitor. Just look at the source. If no source exists, source is your mind. You should be able to type with closed eyes.
- Corrections come after type, not during type.
- Opposite hand presses the Shift key for capital letters, or whenever required.

Touch-typing is what I might describe as "typing fast on keyboard, without seeing it and using 9 fingers". But why it's called touch-typing? It's simply because you must not look at the keyboard, and the only way you can get a sense of where your fingers are right now, is by touching keyboard, specifically some keys which are designed so. However, I might say that <em>touch-typing</em> is not a good term (ND or non-deductive) and a more deductive term (an MDT) for it might be <em>fast-typing</em>. Because semantics here is the emphasis on speed in using keyboard and pressing keys, not in touching the keyboard.

### Why

- Data entry volume measurement (you need to install a keystroke counter application, like WhatPulse)
- Your speed (you need to measure your speed using some touch-typing speed meter applications, like TypingMaster)
- Calculating the time you can gain by touch-typing
