### Notes

- Ellipsis => sum of distances of each point on it to its foci is constant
- kepler's third law => orbital period is proportional to distance
    - ![Kepler's third law](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P^2\propto{a^3})
- Using Kepler's third law, it's possible to find the distance of planets to the sun
- We detected sun's rotation using its dark spots (as markers)
