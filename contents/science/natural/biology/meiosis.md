- recombinant chromosome
- nucleous
- mitotic spindle
- kinetichore
- centromere
- metaphase plate
- pole
- nuclear membrane

- distribution
- biological variation
- phenotype
- genetics

### Notes

- Any living being starts with a cell
- Where does the first cell come from? parent(s)
- How about the first cell of all time? Origin of the life?
- variation, from generation to generation => meiosis + chromosomal crossover + fertilization
