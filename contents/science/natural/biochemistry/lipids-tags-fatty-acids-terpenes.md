### Notes

- lipid => nonpolar => not water-soluble
- lipids are not big enough to be classified as macromolecules (unlike DNA and protein and polysaccarides)
- TAGs at room temperature
    - liquid = oil
    - solid = fat
- fatty acids are carboxylic acids
- man-made fatty acid => contains trans
    - more linear
    - higher melting point
    - more difficult metabolism
- omega-3 => third carbon has double bond
