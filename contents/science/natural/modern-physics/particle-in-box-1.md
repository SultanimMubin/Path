### Notes

- infinite potential = mathematical way of saying the particle is definitely not there (why?)
- Shrodinger equation tells us **how** rather than **where**. Change over time and space, rather than a snapshot in a single time and space.
- ![Time-independent Shrodinger equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial{x^2}}=E\psi)
- zero energy means particle does not exist
- derivative of sin(x) is cos(x)
- derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x)
