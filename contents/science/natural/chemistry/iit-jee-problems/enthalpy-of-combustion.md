# IIT/JEE Chemistry Practice #26: Enthalpy of Combustion

### Concepts

- enthalpy of combustion
- formation
- carbon dioxide
- gas
- liquid
- solid
- glucose
- joule
- mole
- gram
- thermochemistry
- standard enthalpy of combustion
- combustion reaction
- oxygen
- combustion reaction
- analysis
- sum
- product
- reactant
- plug in
- coefficient
- balanced equation
- subtraction
- element
- compound
- arithmetic

---

### Notes

- combustion reaction = reaction with oxygen
- ![Combustion enthalpy formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Delta{H^\circ}_{reaction}=\Sigma\Delta{H\circ}_{f}(products)-\Sigma\Delta{H^\circ}_{f}(reactants))
- We don't have heats of formation for elements, only for compounds
