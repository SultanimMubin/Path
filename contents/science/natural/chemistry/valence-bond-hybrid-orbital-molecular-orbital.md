### Notes

- covalent bond = overlap of orbitals
- for hydrogen, a diatomic molecule (molecular orbital of covalent bond) has lower energy than single hydrogen atom
- number of orbitals is a conserved quantity in chemical reactions
- any orbital (atomic or molecular) can hold two electrons
- sp3 orbital = one s orbital + 3 p orbitals = 4 bonds
- energy level can have
    - 1 s orbital
    - 3 p orbitals
    - 5 d orbitals
