### Notes

- allowed precision = one digit further than the level of precision inherint in the measurement instrument
- sig fig rules
    - non-zero digit is significant
    - zeros in between other digits are significant
    - leading zeros are not significant
    - trailing zeros
        - if decimal zeros, they are significant
        - if not, they are not significant
- calculation rules
    - addition or subtraction
        - lowest sig fig count
    - multiplication or division
        - lowest number of digits
