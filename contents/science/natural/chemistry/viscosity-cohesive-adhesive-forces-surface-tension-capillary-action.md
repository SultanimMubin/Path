### Notes

- viscosity = resistance to flow
    - my personal mnemonic = fluid stubbornness
- ![Capillary action formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?h=\frac{2Tcos(\theta)}{r\rho{g}})
    - h = height
    - T = surface tension
    - Theta = contact angle between the liquid and the tube
    - r = radius of the tube
    - œÅ = liquid density
    - g = acceleration due to gravity
