### Notes

- valence bond theory => covalent bond = localized between a pair of atoms
- molecular orbital = combination of atomic orbital wave functions
- any full orbital = 2 electrons of opposite spin
- constructive interference of two atomic orbitals = bond orbital
- destructive interference of two atomic orbitals = anti-bond orbital
- p orbitals overlap
    - direct => sigma bond
    - lateral => pi bond
- Atomic p orbital mixings
    - ![Atomic p orbital mixing](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\sigma_{px},\sigma^*_{px},\pi_{py},\pi^*_{py},\pi_{pz},\pi^*_{pz})
- we fill orbitals from lower energy to higher energy (Aufbau principle)
- put one electron in each degenerate orbital (same-energy level) before doubling (Hund's rule)
