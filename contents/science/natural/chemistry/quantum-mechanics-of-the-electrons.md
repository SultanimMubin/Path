### Notes

- quantum theory's first step => energy is not continuous, but quantized   
- ![De Broglie's equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\lambda=\frac{h}{mv})
    - lambda = wavelength
    - h = Planck's constant
    - m = relativistic mass
    - v = speed
    - mv = p = momentum
- large object's wavelength at everyday speeds is negligible because it's less than Planck's constant, but subatomic particle's wavelength is noticeable   
- ![Heisenberg's uncertainty principle](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\Delta{x}\Delta{p}\geq\frac{h}{4\pi})
- If we could measure both position and momentum of an electron with 100% certainty, then it would be a particle. But it's not a particle, it's a wave-particle. Thus we can't know it's position and momentum at the same time.
- nature works, whether we like it or dislike it, whether we understand it or not
