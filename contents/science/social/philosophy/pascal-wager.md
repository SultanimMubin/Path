### Notes

- pragmatism
    - working belief > true belief
- Pascal's wager
    - less related to the real existence of God
    - more related to the practicality of believing in God's existence
- Pascal's technique
    - brainwash yourself into true belief
- Circular faith:
    - I have faith in things I choose to have faith in
