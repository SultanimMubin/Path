### Notes

- ![Quadrilateral hierarchy](https://www.google.com/search?q=quadrilaterals+hierarchy&oq=quadrilaterals+hierarchy&aqs=chrome..69i57.192j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
- Any square is a rectangle, but any rectangle is not necessarily a square
- regular polygon
  - all sides are equal
  - all angles are equal
- polygon angles sum
    - (n - 2) * 180
    - because any polygon can be divided into n-2 triangles
        - from one vertice, to all other vertices
