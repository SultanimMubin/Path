### Notes

- Liebniz notation
    - function => y = f(x)
    - first derivative = dy/dx
        - ![First derivative](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{\partial{y}}{\partial{x}})
    - second derivative = d(dy/dx)/dx = d^2y/dx^2
        - ![Second derivative](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{\partial^2{y}}{\partial{x^2}})
- second derivative = rate of change of rate of change
- kinematics = the study of motion
