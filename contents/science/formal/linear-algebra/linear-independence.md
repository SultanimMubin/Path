### Notes

- all vectors in a vector space are linearly independent, only and if only, the only coefficient for all of them should be zero to yeild a zero sum result. Otherwise, vectors are linearly dependent
    - ![Linearly independent vectors in vector space](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?c_1\overrightarrow{v}_1+c_2\overrightarrow{v}_2+...+c_n\overrightarrow{v}_n=0)
- if determinant is zero, vector set are linearly dependent
- if determinant is nonzero, vector set are linearly independent
