### Notes

- inverse matrix notation
    - matrix = A
    - inverse matrix = A + -1 as the superscript
    - ![Inverse matrix](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?A^{-1})
    - It is not exponent
- algorithm
    - swap positions
    - switch signs
    - divide by determinant
- we have matrix multiplication, but we don't have matrix division
- matrix multiplication is not commutative
- ![Inverse of the product of matrices](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?(BA)^{-1}=A^{-1}B^{-1})
- not all matrices have an inverse (if the matrix determinant is zero, its inverse is division by zero)
