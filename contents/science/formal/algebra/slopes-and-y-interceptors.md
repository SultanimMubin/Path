### Notes

- slope = line's rate of change in the vertical direction
- line => y = mx + b
- slope = rise over run
- vertical slope = rise/run = infinity/zero => undefined
- horizontal slope = rise/run = zero/infinity => 0
- any two points define a line
- any line continas infinite points
- one point and slope defines a line
