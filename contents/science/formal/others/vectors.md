### Notes

- in math, we are always dealing with numbers
- vector = magnitude + direction = how much? + towards where?
- ![Vector from A to B](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\overrightarrow{AB})
- verctor multiplication
    - number => magnitude
    - sign => direction
- unit vector => length = 1
- unit vectors
    - x axis = i
    - y axis = j
    - z axis = k
    - xyz and ijk are both alphabet sequences
